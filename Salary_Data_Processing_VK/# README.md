# Created by:  Victor Kadiri

# Date Created: 15th March 2025

# Purpose: This Python and R model is created to perform data processing, error and file handling procedures. The script utilizes series of functions, libraries and syntax to address its objectives.

# Desired Output: The final output will be saved into physical files "employee_details.csv",  zipped file "employee_profile.zip" and "employee_details-r.csv" for the R script

# Datasets Required: Salary data which contains salaries for San Francisco employee from 2011 - 2018 was used to perform this analysis. Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/code/itshorus/sf-salary

# Scripts Required: 
# a. Salary_function_Python.py
# b. Salary_function_R.r

# Tools and Installations Required:
# 1. Download and Install VS Code 
# 2. Download and Install Python 3.12.9 or higher
# 3. Download and Install R 4.3.0 or higher

# Procedures Performed:
# Step 1: Launch the VS Code application
# Step 2: Download the ZIP folder and Unzip
# Step 3: Create three folders( i. "input", "output", "scripts") in your desired location
# Step 4: Download the salary data from the data source into the "input" folder
# Step 5: Download the script source files (a.Salary_Function_Python.py and b.Salary_Function_R.r ) from the GIT repos into the "script" folder
# Step 6: Locate and open the script source files using VS code
# Step 7: Update input and output file paths to your desired location.
# Step 5: Locate and Click the "Run" button on each script file (a.Salary_Function_Python.py and b.Salary_Function_R.r )
# Step 8: View the outputs on each terminal panes or or locate the results in the output folder on your PC.

# Note: Refer to the individual scripts for a detailed step by step procedures performed to achieve the data processing, error and file handling procedures.
